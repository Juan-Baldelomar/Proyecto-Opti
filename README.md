# Proyecto-Opti
Proyecto Final del Curso de Optimizaci√≥n

1. The project contains a File to generate data with nosie from a given model and some number of outliers. 

2. Then a model can be adjusted to the dataset (one generated by the program or another one) and the program will return the optimal parameters and the number of 
   trusted points
   

3. Work is based on the paper:
